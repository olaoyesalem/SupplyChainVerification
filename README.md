# SupplyChainVerification
The SupplyChainVerification smart contract is designed for decentralized supply chain verification using Proof of Identity. This contract allows producers to add products to the supply chain, and verifiers to verify these products at various steps. The contract ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability in the supply chain process.
